# Corey Mitchell's Portfolio

This is my coding porfolio for showing off the work that I have accomplished in class thus far.  Page includes my work so far, an about me section and a working contact form. Feel free to contact me here if you would like to get ahold of me for future work.


## Plans for my porfolio

1. I would like to change up the color palette a little bit.

2. Need to add links to my other web medias.

3. Would like to add my music accomplishments as well.

4. Have PHP files for releasing under personal server.
